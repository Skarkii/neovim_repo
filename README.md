## Config Files
My neovim configuration, setting up lsp-servers and other useful commands.

Clone this repo using this command
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Skarkii/neovim_repo ~/.config/nvim/
```

Run the following code to install packer from wbthomason:
```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/  ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

Run the command ``nvim`` to start neovim and ignore all errors, when possible run the command ``:PackerSync``.


This can automatically be installed by using https://github.com/Skarkii/wsl_arch_setup script along with the rest of my configuration.
